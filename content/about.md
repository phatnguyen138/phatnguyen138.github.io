## Hi, I'm Phat Nguyen. 👋

I am a **DevOps Engineer**, passionate about building scalable cloud infrastructure and automating the boring stuff.

### Why this blog?

I believe that the best way to master a concept is to explain it to someone else.

In the world of DevOps, tools change rapidly—today it's Jenkins, tomorrow it's GitHub Actions; today it's EC2, tomorrow it's Serverless. This blog serves as my **digital garden** and documentation hub.

Here, I share:
* **Practical guides** on AWS, Terraform, and Kubernetes.
* **Solutions** to specific errors I’ve spent hours debugging (so you don't have to).
* **Deep dives** into Linux internals and Security best practices.

My goal isn't just to show "how" to do something, but to explore "why" we do it that way.

### My Tech Philosophy

I am a strong advocate for **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and **Immutable Infrastructure**. I believe that if you have to SSH into a server to fix it, something has gone wrong in the pipeline.

**My daily toolkit includes:**
* **Cloud:** AWS (Primary), GCP
* **IaC:** Terraform, Terragrunt, Ansible
* **Code:** Go, Python, Bash
* **Observability:** Datadog, Prometheus, Grafana

### Beyond the Terminal

When I'm not writing YAML or optimizing pipelines, I enjoy exploring new technologies and reading. Sounds like a real nerd.

### Let's Connect

I am always open to discussing Cloud architecture, new tech stacks, or just chatting about the latest industry trends.
