[{"content":" Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m Phat Nguyen. 👋 # I am a DevOps Engineer, passionate about building scalable cloud infrastructure, ensuring security, and automating the boring stuff. Check out my full professional history in my Resume.\nWhy this blog? # I believe the best way to master a concept is to explain it to someone else.\nIn the DevOps world, tools evolve rapidly—today it\u0026rsquo;s Jenkins, tomorrow GitHub Actions; today EC2, tomorrow Serverless. This blog serves as my digital garden and documentation hub.\nHere, I share:\nPractical guides on AWS, Kubernetes, and IaC. Troubleshooting logs for specific errors I’ve spent hours debugging (so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to). Deep dives into Linux internals and Security best practices. My goal isn\u0026rsquo;t just to show how to do something, but to explore why we do it that way.\nMy Tech Philosophy # I am a strong advocate for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Immutable Infrastructure.\n\u0026ldquo;If you have to SSH into a server to fix it, something has gone wrong in the pipeline.\u0026rdquo;\nMy daily toolkit includes:\nAWS Google CloudGCP TerraformTerraform TerraformTerragrunt AnsibleAnsible GoGo PythonPython GNU BashBash DatadogDatadog PrometheusPrometheus GrafanaGrafana Beyond the Terminal # When I\u0026rsquo;m not writing YAML or optimizing pipelines, I step away from the screen.
