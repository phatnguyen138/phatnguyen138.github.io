[{"content":" Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m Phat Nguyen. 👋 # I am a DevOps Engineer, passionate about building scalable cloud infrastructure and automating the boring stuff.\nWhy this blog? # I believe that the best way to master a concept is to explain it to someone else.\nIn the world of DevOps, tools change rapidly—today it\u0026rsquo;s Jenkins, tomorrow it\u0026rsquo;s GitHub Actions; today it\u0026rsquo;s EC2, tomorrow it\u0026rsquo;s Serverless. This blog serves as my digital garden and documentation hub.\nHere, I share:\nPractical guides on AWS, Terraform, and Kubernetes. Solutions to specific errors I’ve spent hours debugging (so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to). Deep dives into Linux internals and Security best practices. My goal isn\u0026rsquo;t just to show \u0026ldquo;how\u0026rdquo; to do something, but to explore \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; we do it that way.\nMy Tech Philosophy # I am a strong advocate for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Immutable Infrastructure. I believe that if you have to SSH into a server to fix it, something has gone wrong in the pipeline.\nMy daily toolkit includes:\nCloud: AWS (Primary), GCP IaC: Terraform, Terragrunt, Ansible Code: Go, Python, Bash Observability: Datadog, Prometheus, Grafana Beyond the Terminal # When I\u0026rsquo;m not writing YAML or optimizing pipelines, I enjoy exploring new technologies and reading. Sounds like a real nerd.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s Connect # I am always open to discussing Cloud architecture, new tech stacks, or just chatting about the latest industry trends.\nEmail: minhphatnguyen6@gmail.com GitHub: github.com/phatnguyen138 LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/phatnguyen138 ","date":"13 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"The Linux Monk","summary":"","title":"About Me","type":"page"},{"content":" Phat Nguyen # DevOps Engineer | Cloud Engineer | Platform Engineer\n📧 minhphatnguyen6@gmail.com | 🌐 phatnguyen138.github.io | 💻 GitHub\nProfessional Summary # I work as a DevOps / Cloud Engineer, focusing on Linux-based systems, AWS, and infrastructure as code.
