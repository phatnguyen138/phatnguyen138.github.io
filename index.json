It was during my third year of university.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t switch because I wanted to be \u0026ldquo;that Linux guy\u0026rdquo; in class, or because of the fancy features everyone talks about. My Windows laptop simply couldn\u0026rsquo;t handle the workload anymore. Between running heavy Java applications and trying to spin up multiple Docker containers, my machine just can not handle it.\nI knew it was time to try something different—something I had always wanted to do but never did. I decided to install Linux.\nLike any other guys that made the first step into Linux, it was like a maze of distro, kernel or desktop environment. It was exciting. Choosing a distro felt like picking a character class in an RPG video game—each one looked unique, specialized, and just plain cool.\nThis is how my journey started. Now, I want to share that journey with you.\nThe Obvious Choice: Ubuntu # I think this is how 90% of us start our Linux journey. I went searching on the Internet and ended up with the default choice: Ubuntu.\nThe first time booting Ubuntu on my Asus TUF Gaming Laptop was unforgettable. I was so satisfied with how it looked, how it felt, and how every GNOME component worked together. The UI was strange yet magical to me. I spent two days exploring this new OS, installing everything I wanted, and playing with the terminal (since I already had some experience fighting with WSL2). Everything felt perfect.\nUnfortunately, the honeymoon didn\u0026rsquo;t last long. Once I had my full stack installed — VS Code, Docker, IntelliJ, Postman — the reality hit.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, the native Docker performance was out of this world compared to Windows. But when I stopped playing around and tried to do actual work, I faced the exact same problem that made me leave Windows.\nEverything was just\u0026hellip; heavy. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how else to explain it, but the system felt sluggish. My laptop only had 8GB of RAM at the time, so running two Postgres databases alongside my Spring Boot project made everything crawl.\nOnly later did I discover that Snap packages were the likely culprit behind the sluggishness. But by the time I realized that, it was too late. I had already set my sights on my next destination: Linux Mint.\nThe Antidote : Linux Mint # If Ubuntu is the most famous distro, then Linux Mint is arguably the most loved.\nAll I knew about Mint at the time was that it was based on Ubuntu and offered the most Windows-like experience.\nThe setup process was pain-free. It came with almost everything I needed out of the box. But the real game-changer—and the reason I stayed—was the performance. It was incredibly smooth and lightweight, completely solving the lag issues I had with Ubuntu.\nI used the Cinnamon edition. Since the interface was so similar to Windows, I felt at home immediately. It might sound weird for a \u0026ldquo;distro hopper,\u0026rdquo; but I barely customized anything on Mint.\nThat turned out to be a blessing in disguise. By spending less time tweaking the UI, I had more time to mess around with the terminal—which became my favorite playground.\nThis is where I spent the most significant part of my early DevOps journey. It was on Mint that I truly got my hands dirty with the OS, the command line, coding, and cloud computing.\nOne final thing I have to mention: NVIDIA Drivers. On other distros, this can be a nightmare, but Mint’s Driver Manager made it a breeze. Huge thanks to the Mint team for that.\nI honestly thought Mint would be my endgame. But as my love for Linux grew, so did my curiosity. I knew I had to dig deeper into the Linux ecosystem.\nThe Professional Turn: Fedora # Linux Mint is fantastic, and I would still recommend it to anyone starting their Linux journey today.\nHowever, as I got more comfortable, I hit a bottleneck: The Kernel. Since Mint is based on Ubuntu LTS, the kernel is often outdated. It has to wait for Ubuntu to update, and then Mint updates itself. I wanted something fresher.\nThat’s when I heard about Fedora—the distro recommended by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux himself.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t just the celebrity endorsement that drew me in. I learned that Fedora ships a \u0026ldquo;Vanilla\u0026rdquo; kernel, meaning they barely modify the original code. While other distros patch and tweak the kernel, Fedora delivers it almost exactly as the developers intended.\nIt was also time for me to leave the Debian-based ecosystem (Ubuntu, Mint, Pop!_OS) and try something new. And surprisingly, I fell back in love with GNOME. While I hated it on Ubuntu, the \u0026ldquo;pure\u0026rdquo; GNOME experience on Fedora feels modern, fluid, and has excellent UX. Some say it’s a macOS clone, but honestly? I love it.\nThe performance difference was immediate. Access to a newer kernel meant better hardware support and features that didn\u0026rsquo;t exist in older versions. But the biggest win was the lack of bloat. I was traumatized by Snap packages on Ubuntu; they were just too heavy for daily usage.\nFedora was a breath of fresh air. DNF (the package manager) is a game-changer—it’s structured, reliable, and combined with Flatpak, it fulfills all my software needs without slowing down the system.\nThis was also where I started experimenting with advanced workflows. I moved to i3 (a tiling window manager), and Fedora handled it perfectly.\nOverall, Fedora remains my top choice for professional work. It strikes the perfect balance between stability, bleeding-edge features, and a clean user experience.\nThe Monk’s Path: Void Linux # If Linux Mint is a comfortable home and Fedora is a high-tech office, then Void Linux is an empty dojo high up in the mountains.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t switch to Void because I needed another daily driver. I switched because I wanted to understand Linux at its core. I was tired of \u0026ldquo;magic\u0026rdquo; happening in the background. I wanted full control.\nVoid is not for the faint of heart. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t hold your hand. There is no graphical installer welcoming you with a slideshow. From the moment you boot the live ISO, the system expects you to know what you are doing—or at least, be willing to read the documentation and learn the hard way.\nThe biggest culture shock—and the main reason I came here—was the init system. Every other distro I had used (Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora) relied on systemd. While powerful, systemd is complex and does a lot of things behind the scenes.\nVoid uses runit.\nThe difference was night and day. runit is incredibly simple. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t try to do everything; it just starts your services and gets out of the way. For the first time, I could actually read and understand the scripts that started my computer. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t a black box anymore; it was transparent.\nAnd the payoff? Speed. Absolute, raw speed.\nMy laptop boots faster than I can open the lid. The system feels instantaneous. When I log in, the system idles at around 200MB of RAM. Coming from the heavy memory usage of GNOME on Ubuntu, this felt like magic. There is zero bloat because you are the one adding every single package. Nothing exists on your drive without your permission.\nVoid isn\u0026rsquo;t just an Operating System to me; it\u0026rsquo;s a philosophy. It forced me to stop relying on automated tools and start understanding how filesystems, permissions, and services actually interact under the hood.\nIt didn\u0026rsquo;t just make me a better Linux user; it made me a better engineer. This pursuit of simplicity, control, and deep understanding is exactly why I started this blog.\nIt is the path of the Linux Monk.\n","date":"15 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/my-linux-journey/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The First Step into the Temple: How I Started My Linux Journey","type":"posts"},{"content":"Welcome!
