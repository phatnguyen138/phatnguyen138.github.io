I remember exactly when I first entered the world of **Linux**. It was during my third year of university.

I didn't switch because I wanted to be "that Linux guy" in class, or because of the fancy features everyone talks about. My Windows laptop simply couldn't handle the workload anymore. Between running heavy **Java** applications and trying to spin up multiple **Docker** containers, my machine just can not handle it.

I knew it was time to try something different—something I had always wanted to do but never did. I decided to install **Linux**.

Like any other guys that made the first step into **Linux**, it was like a maze of distro, kernel or desktop environment. It was exciting. Choosing a distro felt like picking a **character class** in an RPG video game—each one looked unique, specialized, and just plain cool.

This is how my journey started. Now, I want to share that journey with you.

## The Obvious Choice: Ubuntu

I think this is how **90%** of us start our **Linux** journey. I went searching on the Internet and ended up with the default choice: **Ubuntu**.

The first time booting **Ubuntu** on my **Asus TUF Gaming Laptop** was unforgettable. I was so satisfied with how it looked, how it felt, and how every **GNOME** component worked together. The UI was strange yet magical to me. I spent two days exploring this new OS, installing everything I wanted, and playing with the terminal (since I already had some experience fighting with **WSL2**). Everything felt perfect.

Unfortunately, the honeymoon didn't last long. Once I had my full stack installed — **VS Code**, **Docker**, **IntelliJ**, **Postman** — the reality hit.

Don't get me wrong, the native **Docker** performance was out of this world compared to **Windows**. But when I stopped playing around and tried to do actual work, I faced the exact same problem that made me leave **Windows**.

Everything was just... heavy. I don't know how else to explain it, but the system felt sluggish. My laptop only had **8GB** of **RAM** at the time, so running two **Postgres** databases alongside my **Spring Boo**t project made everything crawl.

Only later did I discover that **Snap** packages were the likely culprit behind the sluggishness. But by the time I realized that, it was too late. I had already set my sights on my next destination: **Linux Mint**.

## The Antidote : Linux Mint

If **Ubuntu** is the most famous distro, then **Linux Mint** is arguably the most loved.

All I knew about **Mint** at the time was that it was based on **Ubuntu** and offered the most **Windows-like** experience.

The setup process was pain-free. It came with almost everything I needed out of the box. But the real game-changer—and the reason I stayed—was the performance. It was incredibly smooth and lightweight, completely solving the lag issues I had with **Ubuntu**.

I used the **Cinnamon** edition. Since the interface was so similar to **Windows**, I felt at home immediately. It might sound weird for a "distro hopper," but I barely customized anything on Mint.

That turned out to be a blessing in disguise. By spending less time tweaking the UI, I had more time to mess around with the terminal—which became my favorite playground.

This is where I spent the most significant part of my early **DevOps** journey. It was on **Mint** that I truly got my hands dirty with the OS, the command line, coding, and cloud computing.

One final thing I have to mention: **NVIDIA Drivers**. On other distros, this can be a nightmare, but **Mint’s Driver Manager** made it a breeze. Huge thanks to the **Mint** team for that.

I honestly thought **Mint** would be my endgame. But as my love for Linux grew, so did my curiosity. I knew I had to dig deeper into the **Linux** ecosystem.

## The Professional Turn: Fedora


## The Monk’s Path: Void Linux
